### Learn Web Development 

This repository contains a curriculum intended to take anyone who is interested in learning modern software development for the web from complete beginner to junior developer. Starting from scratch and assuming 40 hours of time spent working per week, it will take 6 months to complete. If you have some programming experience or experience in a field that requires procedural thinking, it may go more quickly. The course starts off a little slower but quickly ramps up to get you working on real projects. 

A few tips before we start:

1. Find other people near your skill level to collaborate with. Software engineering projects in the real world are very collaborative, and I have found that many people learn best in a group. 
2. Explore outside of this curriculum. This course will give you a solid understanding of web development (mainly JavaScript) which is a great place to start, but the scope of this course is relatively narrow compared to all the software related things you could end up doing for a job. Once you understand the fundementals, don't be afraid to venture outside of this course. Let your curiousity get the best of you.
3. Don't get discouraged. Progamming is pretty hard. I have seen more than a few adults throw a full on tantrum while learning to program, and even the best in the world have bad days. Aim to understand the concepts you find frusturating. I promise this is part of the process and you will get through it. Learning to work through hard problems and keep your cool is imperative.
4. Google will be your best friend. Learn to use it well.
