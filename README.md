### Learn Web Development 

This repository is a curriculum intended to take anyone who is interested in learning modern software development for the web from complete beginner to junior developer. Starting from scratch and assuming 40 hours of time spent working per week, it will take 6 months to complete. If you have some experience in a field that requires procedural thinking, it may go more quickly. The course starts off a little slower but quickly ramps up to get you working on real projects. 

A few tips before we start:

1. Find other people near your skill level to collaborate with. Software engineering projects in the real world are very collaborative, and I have found that many people learn best in a group. 
2. Explore outside of this cirriculm. This course will give you a solid understanding of JavaScript and web development, which is a great place to start, but the scope of this course is relatively narrow compared to all the software related things you could end up doing for a job.
